# AI Chat Application Planning Document

## Overview

An intelligent chat application that leverages OpenAI's GPT models, enhanced with semantic memory and context awareness. Built using Vue 3, TypeScript, and Supabase, this application aims to create a more meaningful and context-aware AI chat experience.

## Current Implementation

### Core Technologies

- **Frontend**: Vue 3 + TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js Express server
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4
- **Development**: MCP (Machine Coding Partner) for AI-assisted development

### Current Features

1. **Real-time Chat Interface**

   - Clean, modern UI with distinct message styling
   - Automatic message persistence
   - Smooth scrolling and focus management

2. **Conversation Management**

   - Persistent conversation storage in Supabase
   - Automatic message syncing
   - System message handling for consistent AI personality

3. **State Management**
   - Reactive state handling using Vue's composition API
   - Service-based architecture for business logic
   - Clean separation of concerns between UI and data management

## Planned Features

### Phase 1: Semantic Analysis & Tagging (In Progress)

- Automatic tag generation from message content
- Semantic analysis of conversations
- Tag-based message organization
- Real-time tag updates

### Future Phases

#### Memory System

- Short-term context awareness
- Mid-term knowledge retention
- Long-term concept storage
- Semantic connections between conversations

#### Enhanced Context Awareness

- Related conversation suggestions
- Concept linking across chats
- Smart context switching

#### Knowledge Management

- Conversation summarization
- Concept extraction
- Knowledge graph visualization
- Export capabilities

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Current Tables
conversations
  - id
  - created_at
  - user_id

messages
  - id
  - conversation_id
  - role
  - content
  - created_at

-- Planned Tables (Next Phase)
tags
  - id
  - name
  - type
  - created_at

message_tags
  - message_id
  - tag_id
  - relevance_score
  - created_at
```

### Component Structure

- `App.vue`: Main application container
- `ConversationManager.ts`: Chat state and API management
- `TagManager.ts` (Planned): Semantic analysis and tag management

## Development Workflow

1. Feature planning and documentation
2. Implementation with AI assistance
3. Testing and refinement
4. Documentation updates
5. GitHub checkpoint commits

## Notes

- Each feature is built incrementally with working checkpoints
- Focus on maintainable, well-documented code
- Emphasis on user experience and accessibility
- Regular documentation updates as features are added
